## 🌌 The Orbital Philosophy
Traditional productivity apps treat all tasks as equal. Perispace acknowledges that your brain functions differently depending on your environment. It organizes your life into three distinct **Orbits**:

* **🔵 Inner Circle (Focus):** Professional & Deep Work. Work-locked targets and high-gravity productivity.
* **🟣 Outer Orbit (Discovery):** Learning, Research, & Hobbies. The space for growth and tangential thinking.
* **💗 Deep Space (Reset):** Family, Relaxation, & Recovery. All work-related targets are hidden to eliminate mental load.

## 🛠️ Core Systems

### 📡 Stellar Comms (Capture)
A specialized audio and multimedia logging engine. Capture "Signals" (voice notes) with a plasma-wave visualizer and mission timer. Archive text and images directly into the Vault.

### 🗺️ Infinite Space (Whiteboard)
A persistent, zoomable canvas for spatial thinking. Map out complex projects using "Context Shards" (notes) that stay exactly where you place them.

### 🛰️ Auto-Pilot (Automation)
* **Geofence Beacons:** Auto-engage **Inner Circle** when arriving at work or **Deep Space** when arriving at home.
* **Temporal Shifting:** Define your "Work Shift" times to lock your focus into the Inner Circle automatically.

### 🗄️ The Vault (Search Index)
A permanent, searchable archive of all captured transmissions. Filter your history in real-time using the deep-search index.
